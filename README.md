# hivetrack

A decentralized tool for tracking and managing community progress through transparent, blockchain-based task management and governance.

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Hivetrack provides a comprehensive framework for decentralized community management, enabling:

- Creation and management of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
- Transparent task tracking and progress management
- Community governance and collective decision-making
- Flexible reward distribution systems
- Secure treasury management and fund allocation

## Smart Contracts

### DAO Governance (`dao-governance`)

The core contract managing community organizations and governance processes.

Key features:
- DAO creation with customizable parameters
- Membership management (open, invite-only, or token-based)
- Proposal creation and voting mechanisms
- Role-based access control
- Configurable voting thresholds and periods

### Task Tracking (`task-tracking`)

Handles the creation, assignment, and monitoring of community tasks.

Key features:
- Task creation with detailed metadata
- Milestone tracking and verification
- Priority and status management
- Category and goal organization
- Progress tracking and completion verification

### Reward Distribution (`reward-distribution`)

Manages incentives and compensation for community contributions.

Key features:
- Multiple reward models (fixed, proportional, reputation-based)
- Reward pool management
- Automated distribution based on task completion
- Reputation tracking and rewards scaling
- Configurable distribution rules

### Community Treasury (`community-treasury`)

Secures and manages community funds with transparent allocation.

Key features:
- Secure fund management
- Project-based allocations
- Multi-signature withdrawal approvals
- Contribution tracking
- Transaction history and event logging

## Getting Started

To integrate Hivetrack into your community:

1. Deploy the core contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize a DAO with your desired governance parameters
3. Set up reward pools and treasury allocations
4. Configure task categories and tracking mechanisms
5. Invite members and establish roles

## Usage Examples

### Creating a DAO
```clarity
(contract-call? .dao-governance create-dao 
    "Community Name"
    "Description"
    u75  ;; 75% voting threshold
    u144 ;; 24-hour voting period (in blocks)
    "open" ;; membership type
)
```

### Creating and Assigning Tasks
```clarity
(contract-call? .task-tracking create-task
    "Task Title"
    "Description"
    u2 ;; Medium priority
    (some u1) ;; Category ID
    (some u1) ;; Goal ID
    (some block-height) ;; Deadline
)
```

### Setting Up Rewards
```clarity
(contract-call? .reward-distribution create-reward-pool
    u1000000 ;; Initial balance
    "fixed" ;; Reward model
    none ;; No specific community ID
)
```

### Managing Treasury
```clarity
(contract-call? .community-treasury create-project
    "Project-1"
    "Project Description"
    u500000 ;; Allocated amount
    u3 ;; Required approvals
)
```

## Contract Interactions

The contracts are designed to work together seamlessly:

- `dao-governance` provides the organizational framework
- `task-tracking` manages work and progress
- `reward-distribution` handles incentives
- `community-treasury` manages funds

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for treasury operations
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Locked periods for certain operations
- Threshold-based approval systems
- Event logging for transparency
